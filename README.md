### Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
Set up automated pipelines to build, test, and deploy your code seamlessly.

### Automated Testing
Ensure code quality by automatically running tests on each code commit.

### Custom Workflows
Define custom workflows to respond to specific events in your repository.

### Automated Release Processes
Simplify versioning, changelog generation, and release artifact creation.

### Integration with Third-Party Services
Integrate with external tools and services to streamline your workflow.

### Version Control and Branch Management
Enforce versioning strategies and branch control for a more organized development process.
