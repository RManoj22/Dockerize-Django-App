# Automating Workflows, Managing Packages, and Ensuring Security with GitHub

# GitHub Actions

Automate your software development workflows with GitHub Actions. This powerful automation platform allows you to streamline tasks, enhance collaboration, and ensure code quality. Here are some key uses of GitHub Actions:

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
Set up automated pipelines to build, test, and deploy your code seamlessly. GitHub Actions enables you to automate your CI/CD process to ensure that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed whenever they're pushed to the repository. To set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Choose a workflow template or create a new workflow file.

## Automated Testing
Ensure code quality by automatically running tests on each code commit. GitHub Actions allows you to define test suites that automatically run whenever code changes are pushed, helping you catch issues early in the development cycle. To set up automated testing:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Choose a workflow template or create a new workflow file with test steps.

## Custom Workflows
Define custom workflows to respond to specific events in your repository. GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows tailored to your team's unique development processes. To create custom workflows:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Create a new workflow file with your desired steps and triggers.

## Automated Release Processes
Simplify versioning, changelog generation, and release artifact creation. GitHub Actions can automate the process of creating release builds, generating changelogs, and packaging artifacts, making the release process more efficient and consistent. To automate release processes:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Choose a workflow template or create a new workflow file for releases.

## Integration with Third-Party Services
Integrate with external tools and services to streamline your workflow. GitHub Actions offers a wide range of actions that allow you to interact with third-party services, such as notifications, deployment platforms, and external APIs, enabling you to create end-to-end automation. To integrate with third-party services:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Choose a workflow template or create a new workflow file that includes the necessary actions.

## Version Control and Branch Management
Enforce versioning strategies and branch control for a more organized development process. GitHub Actions can enforce workflows that require specific checks to pass before merging code into protected branches, promoting collaboration and maintaining code quality. To enforce version control and branch management:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Navigate to **Branches** in the left sidebar.
4. Under **Branch protection rules**, configure required status checks and branch restrictions.

# GitHub Packages

Efficiently manage and share your software packages using GitHub Packages. Whether you're working with code libraries or container images, GitHub Packages offers seamless integration with your development process. Here's how you can benefit from it:

- **Package Hosting:** Store and host packages associated with your projects, including dependencies and artifacts.
- **Versioning:** Easily manage different versions of your packages for compatibility and updates.
- **Package Discovery:** Discover and utilize packages from other projects within the GitHub ecosystem.
- **Secure and Scoped Packages:** Host both public and private packages, ensuring security and organization.
- **Multiple Package Formats:** Support for Maven, npm, NuGet, and RubyGems, accommodating various programming languages.

Learn more about GitHub Packages in the [GitHub Packages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages).

# Pushing Docker Image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

This guide outlines the steps to manually build a Docker image and push it to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- A GitHub account

## Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

You can create a Personal Access Token in GitHub by following these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub profile settings.
2. Navigate to **Developer Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens**.
3. Click on **Generate new token** and follow the prompts.


## Steps to Build and Push a Docker Image to GHCR

### 1. Build the Docker Image

	docker build -t {tagname for image} {directory of dockerfile}
	
### 2. Tag the image with github username to push:

 	docker tag {existing tagname} ghcr.io/USERNAME/Packagename:{new tagname}

### Login into GHCR using the Personal Access Token (PAT)
### 3. Store the USERNAME in Env Variable and token in a txt file to avoid exposing the token in cmd history:

	type token.txt | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin

### 4. Push the built image to GHCR using the docker push command:

	docker push ghcr.io/USERNAME/Packagename:{tagname}

## Steps to Pull a Docker Package to Local
### 1. Login into GHCR using the Personal Access Token (PAT)

	type token.txt | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin

### 2. Pull the Docker Image:

	docker pull ghcr.io/USERNAME/Packagename:{tagname}
 
### 3. Use the Pulled Image:

	docker run -it ghcr.io/USERNAME/Packagename:{tagname}

# GitHub Security

Ensure the security of your code and repositories using GitHub Security features. Detect and mitigate vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and protect sensitive information. Here's how GitHub Security can assist you:

## Code Scanning
Identify security vulnerabilities and coding errors in your codebase using automated analysis. GitHub's built-in code scanning tools leverage a variety of security engines to analyze your code for common vulnerabilities, coding mistakes, and potential risks. To enable Code Scanning:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Navigate to **Security & Analysis** in the left sidebar.
4. Under **Code Scanning**, select **Enable**.

## Dependency Insights
Monitor and address known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. GitHub's dependency insights provide an overview of your project's dependencies and their associated security vulnerabilities, helping you stay informed and take action to update or patch vulnerable packages. To enable Dependency Insights:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Insights** tab.
3. Navigate to **Dependency Insights**.

## Secret Scanning
Prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information in your codebase. GitHub automatically scans repositories for potential secrets like API tokens, passwords, and cryptographic keys, helping you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive data. To enable Secret Scanning:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Navigate to **Secrets** in the left sidebar.
4. Under **Secret scanning**, select **Enable secret scanning**.

## Vulnerability Alerts
Receive notifications about new vulnerabilities affecting your repository. GitHub alerts you to security vulnerabilities that may impact your code, enabling you to stay proactive and take appropriate steps to mitigate risks. Vulnerability alerts are enabled by default.

## Security Policies
Set up policies to enforce security practices and prevent risky code merges. Define code analysis and quality checks that must pass before code is merged, ensuring that security standards are maintained throughout the development lifecycle. To set up security policies:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Navigate to **Branches** in the left sidebar.
4. Under **Branch protection rules**, configure required status checks and branch restrictions.

## Collaborative Security
Collaborate on security responses and fixes within your team. GitHub provides tools for team members to discuss, collaborate, and coordinate responses to security incidents, enhancing the overall security posture of your projects.

## Security Advisories
GitHub provides security advisories for vulnerabilities in open-source software packages. When a vulnerability is identified, GitHub offers guidance on mitigation and remediation steps, ensuring that you stay informed and can take appropriate action.
