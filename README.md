1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Create a new workflow file with your desired steps and triggers.

### Triggering Workflows with Multiple Events and Branches

You can trigger a workflow based on multiple types of events and branches. To specify multiple events:

	on:
  	  push:
            branches:
              - main
              - develop
          pull_request:
            types:
              - opened
              - synchronize

In this example, the workflow will trigger on pushes to the main and develop branches, as well as when pull requests are opened or synchronized.
